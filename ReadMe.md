# Personal Organiser

## Personal Project

I have had a desire to make a ToDo list that incorporates the quadrant ideas of importance and urgency. This will also allow me to explore Android app development.

Current goals:
Personal Organiser which aligns with a calendar, displays my todos in order of urgency, has little alerts and toasts to congratulate and encourage completion of more todos.

After which, I will look to expand into how to connect with other users to share group projects, encryption as I don't want anyones(mine included) goals unwillingly shared.
Perhaps a shopping list which also has urgency applied to items.
And notes so that I can do away with two other apps I currently use and continue to grow as a developer.

If you have ideas or pointers to help with my journey please be in touch.
